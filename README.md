# Beast List

Adding to the Beast List  
Build an application that can display our hardcoded data in a Table View, using textField and insert buttons to add new items!  

Challenge: Insert New Tasks  

Go ahead and implement the beastButtonPressed method that will add a new task depending on what the user has inputted in the textField and also reload the tableView to notify the user of the changes in the Model.
